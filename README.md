## POSTER: Scaling Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for Real-Time Modeling of Network Behaviour
#### ABSTRACT:
Network modeling and optimisation has long been a well-established field of study. More recently, Graph Neural Network (GNN) based network models have demonstrated remarkable capability in capturing the complex interactions present in network data without having to make assumptions about physical networks. While this characteristic facilitates integration across various telecom access networks, current benchmark models remain impractical for real-world deployment, as they do not readily align with the real-time demands of modern infrastructure.
This research focuses on developing a scalable solution for high-performance network modeling in large-scale domains such as telecommunication networks. By incorporating distributed learning into the model architecture, we propose a novel network modeling method that effectively addresses computational inefficiency without compromising the modeling accuracy offered by benchmark GNN-based network models. The architecture presented in this poster expands computational capacity to support deeper and larger graphs reflective of real telecom networks. Furthermore, it incorporates native support for fragmented and geographically distributed datasets, reducing reliance on centralized aggregation and improving compatibility with real-world telecom infrastructure. Beyond scalability, the design emphasizes stable optimization dynamics and architectural resilience to enhance reliability in production-like environments. When applied to the state-of-the-art model, our proposed architecture outperforms the original. The model achieved a Pearson correlation of 0.999 with a mean squared error under 0.0005. It also converges faster, with inference speedup scaling proportionally to the number of computational nodes. In our experiments under a single-node, two-worker setup, the architecture achieves approximately 48\% inference speedup, with overall training efficiency improving by 20\%, highlighting the practical benefits of the proposed method in real-world scenarios.
